  s.description = %q{This plugin provides a 'spawn' method to easily fork OR
thread long-running sections of code so that your application can return
results to your users more quickly.  This plugin works by creating new database
connections in ActiveRecord::Base for the spawned block.

The plugin also patches ActiveRecord::Base to handle some known bugs when using
threads (see lib/patches.rb).}
